# Boutique-Sales-Intelligence-Dashboard-development-Project
**About Project**

In this contract project, I was approached by a popular Boutique store in Nigeria to technically break down and solve their business problem: creating a single, simple dashboard to comprehensively present and categorize all their sales fees, profits, cost of goods, sales by goods category, and monthly sales performance. I developed an interactive and real-time dashboard that connected and streamed data from their sales database to monitor the business's daily, weekly, and monthly performance.

With this dashboard, I was able to assist the store outlet in achieving the following objectives:
- Track sales performance by product category.
- Monitor expenses related to advertising.
- Compare sales, profits, and costs of the current month with the previous month's sales statistics.
- Keep a record of daily sales for each day of the month.
- Utilize cards to display summarized data, including total gross sales, total cost, net profit, and the number of items sold per month.
